## Idea

Staying productive requires considerable effort in understanding strategies and common pitfalls, planning tasks to overcome them, and finally carrying out the tasks at hand. Often, our energy gets spent in the first two and by the time we get to actually carrying out our tasks, it is difficult to keep up the willpower or momentum to get things done. 

This project is aimed at tackling this problem. After extensive study about best productivity practices like chunking, pomodoros, gamification etc, we bring to you an application that lets you quickly keep track of multiple goals and deadlines and ensures that you make progress towards all of them. The main differentiator is that we dynamically prepare time tables for you to follow, and this adapts to the tasks you are able to complete and those you aren't.

This helps shift your focus to only working on your tasks so that your productivity is maximized.

## Features

- Static time blocks - e.g. work, college classes
- Dynamic time blocks - e.g. read Algorithms for 30 min
- Simple yet sophisticated UI that allows you to quickly make entries, like
  - task progress
  - new tasks
- Deadlines tracker
- Dynamic scheduling based on pending deadlines
- Help you make progress towards multiple goals e.g. learn piano
